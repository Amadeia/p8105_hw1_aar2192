This is homework 1!

Problem 1
=========

### Creating a **data set** with a sample size of 10

``` r
set.seed(1234)

size10_df = tibble(
  unif_sample = runif(10, 0, 5),
  log_vec_gr2 = c("unif_sample" > 2),
  char_vec_ln10 = c("I", "do", "not", "know", "what", "I", "am", "doing", "right", "now"),
  fact_vec_ln10 = factor(c("one", "two", "three", "one", "one", "three", "two", "two", "two", "three"))
)
```

### Taking the **mean** of log\_vec\_gr2

``` r
mean(size10_df$log_vec_gr2)
```

The mean of log\_vec\_gr2 is 1

While I get a result,this doesn't really make sense as there shouldn't be numerical values attached to a logical vector. In this case the logical vector has been interpreted as numerical, with "TRUE" meaning "1" and "FALSE" meaning "0"

### Taking the **mean** of char\_vec\_ln10

``` r
mean(size10_df$char_vec_ln10)
```

The returned result is a warning message and a returned missing value, NA.

We cannot obtain the mean of a character vector, as it is not numeric.

### Taking the **mean** of fact\_vec\_ln10

``` r
mean(size10_df$fact_vec_ln10)
```

The returned result is a warning message and a returned missing value, NA.

We cannot obtain the mean of a factor vector, as it is not numeric.

### Converting the variables into **numeric** values

``` r
as.numeric(size10_df$log_vec_gr2)
as.numeric(size10_df$char_vec_ln10)
as.numeric(size10_df$fact_vec_ln10)
```

The logical vector and the factor vector converts to numeric, but the character vector is unable to do so. Instead, NAs are introduced by coercion for the character vector.

### Converting the character variable and factor variable into **numeric** values

``` r
as.numeric(as.factor(size10_df$char_vec_ln10))
as.numeric(as.character(size10_df$fact_vec_ln10))
```

The character vector that is first turned into a factor variable and then a numeric vector now has numeric values. Specifically, because I used 8 unique words in my characters, the numeric values include numbers 1-8, with 4 repeated two times. However, the factor vector that is first turned into a character variable and then coerced into numeric gives NA results since a character vector cannot be turned numeric unless it is first turned into a factor.

Problem 2
=========

### Creating a **dataframe** from a normal distribution with 5 variables

``` r
set.seed(1234)
norm_1000_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(1000),
  y = rnorm(1000),
  log_vec_xy = c(x+y > 0),
  num_conversion = as.numeric(log_vec_xy),
  fact_conversion = as.factor(log_vec_xy)
)
```

The size of the dataset is 1000 and the mean and median of *x* is -0.0265972 and -0.0397942, respectively. The mean and median of *y* is 0.0145082 and 0.01364, respectively. The proportion of cases that are TRUE for *log\_vec\_xy* is 498/1000.

### Making a **scatterplot**

``` r
xy_plot1 = ggplot(norm_1000_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color= log_vec_xy)) + geom_point()
```

``` r
xy_plot2 = ggplot(norm_1000_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color= num_conversion)) + geom_point()
```

``` r
xy_plot3 = ggplot(norm_1000_df, aes(x = x, y = y, color= fact_conversion)) + geom_point()
```

The colors for the first and third scatterplot are similar. All the plots only have two colors, as the third variable used for coloring is dichotomous, whether it be logical, a factor, or numeric.

### **Saving** xy\_plot1

``` r
ggsave(file= "xy_plot1.pdf", plot = xy_plot1)
```
